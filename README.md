I am a passionate and detail-oriented Frontend Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience specializing in modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, Remix, and Svelte. I excel at translating business requirements into technical solutions, delivering high-quality, responsive, and mobile-first web applications on time and within budget. Committed to writing clean and maintainable code, I thrive in agile environments while effectively collaborating with cross-functional teams and mentoring junior developers. I am continuously growing by engaging with the tech community, contributing to open-source projects, and staying current with industry best practices. My strong problem-solving skills and clear communication allow me to bridge the gap between technical concepts and stakeholder needs efficiently.
